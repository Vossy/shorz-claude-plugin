# Shorz MCP Server Agent Skill

Before any Shorz MCP tool call, confirm **Shorz is running** and the **MCP server is connected**. For panel-level or project-type-specific work, **load the matching reference file** from `references/` (paths in the tables below) before changing settings or triggering renders.

This skill is the entry point (`SKILL.md`). Detailed workflows live under `references/panel-workflows/` (cross-project panels), `references/project-workflows/` (per-`projectType` end-to-end flows), `references/headless-workflows/` (**project-independent** file operations), and `references/creative-strategy/` (viral formats, hooks, and content brainstorming). The routing tables tell you which file to open.

## Operating Model

- Treat Shorz as a stateful desktop runtime. Always read current state before writes.
- Most menu/panel option changes map to `read_project_settings` + `update_project_settings` (targeted deep-merge patches).
- Generation and long-running workflows are asynchronous. For **project video creation**, poll **`get_video_generation_status`** as the default way to know running vs done vs error. Use **`fetch_app_events`** only if the user asks for live logs/progress, or when you are **diagnosing** a failed or stuck render (see **Event stream**).
- Prefer deterministic/headless arguments (override paths) over dialog-driven behavior.
- **Live UI vs MCP write races** — when the Shorz Electron app has the target project open, certain fields (notably `UI_SETTINGS.user_input_instructions` / PromptBar) can be reactively rewritten by the renderer shortly after an MCP write, because the input box owns its own in-memory state. If a configure-only patch on PromptBar appears to "revert," it is the live UI overwriting disk. Workarounds: write again after a moment, ask the user to close the project, or accept the renderer's value as the new truth. This is not a tool failure — the `set_user_instructions` write itself succeeded.

## Workflow routing

Pick the matching workflow file before editing a project or panel. Don't improvise — the per-file skills lock in tool names, enums, persistence keys, and known clamps/rejects.

### Guided creation (wizard) — vague idea, no concrete inputs

When the user expresses **intent to make a video or asset without the concrete inputs** it needs (no file path/URL, no format, no counts, no script — e.g. "i want to clip a youtube video", "make me an avatar video", "I need a thumbnail", "an animated intro"), do **NOT** improvise questions and do **NOT** start configuring. Open **`references/guided-creation/README.md`** first (trigger rules, question protocol, the 11 design rules, summary + confirmation contract), then run the matching flow:

| Intent sounds like | Guided flow file |
|---|---|
| clip/cut a long video into shorts | `references/guided-creation/clipping.md` |
| edit my own footage/photos into one video | `references/guided-creation/auto-edit.md` |
| make a video about X / from a script / faceless | `references/guided-creation/text-to-video.md` |
| talking head / AI presenter | `references/guided-creation/avatar.md` |
| two-person dialogue / AI podcast | `references/guided-creation/podcast.md` |
| ad / promo for my product | `references/guided-creation/advertisement.md` |
| music video for my song / visualize this track | `references/guided-creation/music-video.md` |
| thumbnail / cover image | `references/guided-creation/thumbnail-creator.md` |
| animated intro, logo reveal, kinetic text, title card | `references/guided-creation/animation-studio.md` |

Each flow asks a short option-driven sequence (interactive question tool when available; ≤4 preset options, recommended default first, custom input always possible, never re-asking anything already given), ends with a readable summary + an explicit confirmation, and only then executes via the matching `references/project-workflows/*.md` or panel workflow. If the user already gave a complete spec, skip the wizard and confirm the gaps in one question.

**Widget steps:** inside every guided flow, the image-slot, model and voice steps are rendered as inline card widgets via the client's `show_widget` tool when it exists (it is usually deferred — `ToolSearch` for it before assuming it is missing). Rules and templates: `references/guided-creation/widgets.md`. On those steps never open the native file picker yourself; the widget's button does.

### Project workflows (one per `projectType`)

| `projectType` | Workflow file | Primary MCP tools |
|---|---|---|
| `auto-edit` | `references/project-workflows/auto-edit.md` | Panel `set_*_settings` (subtitle, title, border, audio, overlay, broll, general video) + `switch_project_aspect_ratio` |
| `auto-edit` / `text-to-video` — **edit an already rendered video** | `references/project-workflows/edit-generated-video.md` | `edit_generated_video` (one plain-text instruction → new version; everything else pinned) |
| `text-to-video` | `references/project-workflows/text-to-video.md` | `set_text_to_video_settings`, `save_text_to_video_speech_audio`, `save_text_to_video_reference_images` |
| `avatar` | `references/project-workflows/avatar.md` | `set_avatar_settings`, `select_avatar_image`, `select_avatar_angle_image`, `select_avatar_audio`, `save_avatar_image`, `save_avatar_audio` |
| `podcast` | `references/project-workflows/podcast.md` | `set_podcast_settings`, `select_podcast_avatar_image`, `list_elevenlabs_voices` |
| `advertisement` | `references/project-workflows/advertisement.md` | `set_advertisement_settings`, `select_advertisement_image`, `remove_advertisement_image` |
| `music-video` | `references/project-workflows/music-video.md` | `select_music_video_audio`, `set_music_video_settings`, `remove_music_video_audio`, `select_music_video_character_image`, `remove_music_video_character_image` |
| `clipping` | `references/project-workflows/clipping.md` | `update_project_settings` (`CLIPING`, `ASSET_PATHS`), `download_social_video`, `switch_project_aspect_ratio` |

### Headless workflows (no project, no `projectType`)

These MCP tools work on **local files only**. They do **not** use projects, `settings.json`, PromptBar, Create Video, or any `projectType`. Do **not** call `create_project` or `read_project_settings` before using them.

| Workflow | File | Primary MCP tools |
|---|---|---|
| Single-file deterministic edits | `references/headless-workflows/single-asset-edit.md` | `trim_video`, `remove_ranges`, `crop_media`, `change_video_speed`, `remove_audio`, `set_audio_volume`, `rotate_media`, `flip_media`, `reverse_video`, `loop_video`, `fade_video`, `freeze_frame`, `set_image_duration`, `audio_fade`, `remove_silence`, `edit_image_with_ai`, `get_media_info`, `resize_media`, `fit_to_aspect`, `extract_audio`, `replace_audio`, `concat_media`, `extract_video_frames` |
| Pexels stock media search | `references/headless-workflows/pexels-stock-media.md` | `pexels_search_photos`, `pexels_search_videos`, `pexels_curated_photos`, `pexels_popular_videos`, `pexels_get_photo`, `pexels_get_video` |
| GIPHY GIF + sticker search and download | `references/headless-workflows/giphy-gifs-stickers.md` | `giphy_search_gifs`, `giphy_search_stickers`, `giphy_trending_gifs`, `giphy_trending_stickers`, `giphy_get_gif`, `download_giphy_gif` (free, signed in; stickers composite as transparent cut-outs, GIFs as opaque clips) |
| Public-domain audio search (SFX + music) | `references/headless-workflows/openverse-audio.md` | `openverse_search_sound_effects`, `openverse_search_music` (`length`: `tracks` \| `loops`), `download_openverse_audio` (**no Shorz credits and no sign-in**; every result is CC0, so the user owes no attribution) |
| X (Twitter) live search | `references/headless-workflows/x-search.md` | `x_search` (natural-language X search with citations; **spends Shorz credits**) |

See **`references/headless-workflows/README.md`** for when to use headless edits vs a full project workflow. To put an edited file into a project afterward, that is a **separate** import step (`import_frontend_assets`, `save_file_as`, or project-specific path patches).

### Companion skills

| Skill | Use it for |
|---|---|
| **`shorz-ui-automation`** | Driving the app through its **actual UI** with a real, visible cursor — tutorial footage, feature demos, screenshots for the website or docs, onboarding walkthroughs. It owns the `get_ui_map` → `ui_click` → `get_ui_map` loop and the six UI tools (`get_ui_map`, `scroll_ui_element_into_view`, `ui_click`, `ui_type`, `ui_press_keys`, `ui_scroll`), which are **not** covered anywhere else in this skill. Load it whenever the deliverable is a *visual of the UI*. For changing a setting or rendering **without filming it**, stay here — the tools in this skill are faster and need no UI. |
| **`shorz-motion-graphics`** | Generating a green-screen motion graphics overlay and chroma-keying it onto an existing video, any length, in `16:9` / `9:16` / `1:1`. Covers every style — explainer graphics, infographics and data callouts, kinetic typography, broadcast lower-thirds, annotation arrows, chapter cards, and high-energy short-form. Load it instead of improvising from the Animation Studio panel workflow whenever the goal is graphics **on top of existing footage** — it carries the source-analysis, safe-zone, segmentation, chroma-key and compositing rules that panel reference does not. |

### Creative and strategy workflows

| Strategy area | Workflow file | Primary purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Content brainstorming & viral playbooks | `references/creative-strategy/content-brainstorming.md` | Designing high-retention hooks, formats, and CTAs mapped to Shorz tools |

Open **`references/creative-strategy/content-brainstorming.md`** when the user asks for content ideas, viral formats, organic growth playbooks, or hook/CTA variants — then switch to the matching **`references/project-workflows/*.md`** (or headless workflow) to execute.

### Panel workflows (cross-project; usable on matching sidebar panels)

| Sidebar panel | Workflow file | Primary MCP tool |
|---|---|---|
| General Video / Auto Zoom | `references/panel-workflows/settings.md` | `set_general_video_settings` |
| B-roll (Assets / Web / GIF / AI / Emoji) | `references/panel-workflows/broll.md` | `set_broll_settings` |
| Audio (mix, dubbing, reverb, visualization) | `references/panel-workflows/audio.md` | `set_audio_settings` + `set_audio_visualization_settings` |
| Overlay | `references/panel-workflows/overlay.md` | `set_overlay_settings` + `get_overlay_effects` lifecycle |
| Border | `references/panel-workflows/border.md` | `set_border_settings` |
| Text → captions / subtitles | `references/panel-workflows/subtitle.md` | `set_subtitle_settings` |
| Text → headline / banner | `references/panel-workflows/title.md` | `set_title_settings` |
| Thumbnail Creator (modal) | `references/panel-workflows/thumbnail-creator.md` | `open_thumbnail_creator`, `set_thumbnail_creator_settings`, `thumbnail_creator_generate`, `get_thumbnail_creator_generation_status` |
| Animation Studio (modal) | `references/panel-workflows/animation-studio.md` | `animation_studio_*`, `compile_remotion_preview`, `remotion_render` |
| Canvas (node-graph video builder, ⋮ → Canvas; no project) | `references/panel-workflows/canvas.md` | `canvas_list`, `canvas_get`, `canvas_build`, `canvas_remove`, `canvas_run` (+ `get_job_status`), `canvas_stop`, `canvas_pick_take`, `canvas_duplicate`, `canvas_rename`, `canvas_delete` |
| Your Library (VIDEO / BROLL / SOUND / MUSIC) | `references/panel-workflows/your-library-assets.md` | `update_project_settings` (`ASSET_PATHS`); `delete_asset` only when deleting files on disk |

The **Text** sidebar shows subtitles and titles together but uses **two** tools with **two** key families (`subtitle*` vs `title*`). Never send subtitle keys to `set_title_settings` or vice versa — for both kinds, call each tool once with a minimal patch.

### Main VIDEO import (“Import Main Assets”) vs project type

In the Electron app, **`import_frontend_assets`** with `assetType: "video"` mirrors the UI **Import Main Assets** lane (fills the main timeline / `assets.VIDEOS`, which persists to **`ASSET_PATHS.main_video_asset_paths`** on save alongside other library categories). The single source of truth is **`isMainAssetsLaneEnabled`** (`frontend/src/utils/mediaAssetUtils.ts`): the main VIDEOS lane is **disabled** for **`podcast`**, **`avatar`**, **`advertisement`**, **`music-video`**, and for **`text-to-video`** unless **`textToVideoSourceMedia === "imported"`**. That rule gates the UI (import button, Your Library → VIDEOS tab, timeline strip) **and is enforced main-process-side**: a headless `import_frontend_assets` call with `overridePaths` and `assetType: "video"` into a lane-disabled open project is **rejected with an error** (redirecting to `"broll"`) instead of persisting `main_video_asset_paths`. Match this in guidance: never tell users they can “add main timeline videos” in templates that hide or disable main-video import.

| `projectType` | Main VIDEO import in UI (timeline / PromptBar gateway) | Your Library shows VIDEOS tab |
|---|---|---|
| `auto-edit` | Yes | Yes |
| `clipping` | Yes (typically one long source patched to **`ASSET_PATHS.main_video_asset_paths`**) | Yes |
| `text-to-video` | **Only when** Source Media is **`imported`** | **Only then** |
| `avatar` | **No** (`canImportMainAssets` false) | **No** |
| `podcast` | **No** (`canImportMainAssets` false) | **No** |
| `advertisement` | **No** (main lane disabled) — **workflow is reference stills**, not a main VIDEO lane — use **`select_advertisement_image`** / **`import_frontend_assets`** with **`image`** | **No** (tab hidden) |
| `music-video` | **No** — the input is the song (**`select_music_video_audio`**); the MUSIC lane is off too, and a headless `"music"` import is **rejected with an error** | **No** (VIDEOS and MUSIC tabs hidden) |

**Agents:** Use **`avatar`**, **`podcast`**, **`advertisement`**, **`music-video`**, **`text-to-video`** (unless `imported`) workflows for their **typed** inputs (still images, avatars, product/person images, script/audio, generated sources). `import_frontend_assets` with **`video`** into these projects is **rejected with an error** (headless `overridePaths` path) — import supporting footage as **`broll`**, which every project type keeps.

### One asset per file name (every library lane)

A lane (VIDEO / BROLL / SOUND / MUSIC) holds **at most one asset per file name** — compared case-insensitively, folder ignored, and **per lane** (the same file may legitimately sit in both VIDEO and BROLL) — because the backend addresses assets by basename: PromptBar `@mentions`, the Python render maps, and music/SFX name lookups. The **UI and MCP enforce the same rule**: `import_frontend_assets` **skips** a file whose name the lane already holds and lists it in **`skipped`** (reason `duplicate-name`), and an `update_project_settings` patch of a lane collapses repeated names and reports **`duplicateAssetNamesDropped`**. Nothing errors and nothing is overwritten — so **always check `skippedCount` before telling the user an import is done**, especially after a paid generation. Need both files? Rename one. Full contract and result shapes: **`references/panel-workflows/your-library-assets.md`** → *One asset per file name*.

### PromptBar semantics by project type

The PromptBar (`set_user_instructions` → `UI_SETTINGS.user_input_instructions`) does **not** mean the same thing for every project type. Source: `frontend/src/data/projects.ts` (`projectTypePromptPlaceholderMap`).

| Type | PromptBar role | Spoken/script content lives in |
|---|---|---|
| `auto-edit` | Primary creative brief (required for Create Video). Can also direct per-clip editing with no panel toggle: transitions between clips, camera motion, speed/volume/reverse/loop/flip/rotate, fill-the-frame framing, beat-synced cuts to imported music, and the imported-music bus itself (MUSIC lane holds any number of tracks, played back to back — the brief can reorder tracks, trim each one, and place/fade/mix the music) — full vocabulary in `references/project-workflows/auto-edit.md` → *What the PromptBar can direct* | n/a |
| `text-to-video` | Optional **look and mood** guidance | `textToVideoScript` (or saved speech audio in `audio` input mode) |
| `avatar` | Optional guidance for **enabled auto-edit features** (captions, B-roll, music, etc.) — **not the spoken script**. Can also arrange imported music (order, sections, placement, volume, fades, mix) | `avatarScript` (script mode) or `avatarAudioUrl` (audio mode) |
| `podcast` | Optional B-roll / music / SFX guidance — **not the dialogue**. Can also arrange imported music (order, sections, placement, volume, fades, mix) | `podcastScript` with `[Interviewer]` / `[Interviewee]` line tags |
| `advertisement` | Ad creative brief | Product/person images via `set_advertisement_settings` |
| `clipping` | **Optional** — only when steering topics, clip length, platform, or hooks | Source video at `ASSET_PATHS.main_video_asset_paths` |
| `music-video` | The creative brief — concept, look, who appears, how each section should feel (**never the lyrics**) | The song, set with `select_music_video_audio` (`MUSIC_VIDEO.music_video_audio_path`); the lyrics are transcribed from it at render time |

**Rule:** Never overwrite PromptBar with a script for `avatar`, `podcast`, or `text-to-video`, or with lyrics for `music-video`. Put the spoken text in the panel field listed above.

**Referencing a specific asset:** to point the brief at one file in the project library, write its **filename in double quotes** — `use "intro.mp4" as the opener`. That is exactly what the desktop app's `@` picker and its drag-from-timeline shortcut insert, and the app renders any such reference as a pill. Get the real filenames from `read_project_settings` (`ASSET_PATHS`) or `get_video_assets` / `get_audio_assets` first — a name that isn't in the library is just prose to the analyzers.

**Output framing (all project types):** PromptBar / `set_user_instructions` text is **never** the place for export geometry. Do **not** include aspect-ratio tokens (`9:16`, `16:9`, `1:1`), pixel dimensions (`1080×1920`, `1920×1080`, `1280×720`), `video_width` / `video_height`, or output **fps** in the creative brief — the project already has **`VIDEO_SIZE`** from the UI or **`switch_project_aspect_ratio`**. Platform or delivery names for creative intent (`TikTok`, `Reels`, `Shorts`, “vertical short”) are fine; technical sizing belongs in the aspect tool, not PromptBar. When the user asks for a format change, call **`switch_project_aspect_ratio`** and strip sizing lines from any PromptBar text you persist.

### PromptBar main AI model

The PromptBar **model dropdown** (all project types) selects which AIML chat model Create Video and backend LLM calls use. It is **not** the same as panel-specific models (`textToVideoImageModel`, thumbnail `imageGenerator`, etc.).

| MCP tool | Persistence | Allowed values |
|---|---|---|
| `set_main_ai_model` | `AI_MODEL.main_ai_model_name` | Server-driven — call **`list_main_ai_models`** for the live lineup and pass an id from its response. At time of writing: `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5` (Opus 5.5, default), `anthropic/claude-fable-5-1` (Fable 5.1), `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5-5` (Sonnet 5.5 — replaced Sonnet 5 on 2026-09-28 by migration `0054`, whose old id still resolves to it; 1 / 2 credits per 1k, the cheapest Claude), `openai/gpt-6-1-sol` (GPT 6.1 Sol — 1 / 2 credits per 1k; replaced GPT 6 Sol on 2026-09-30 at the same price, and `openai/gpt-6-sol` plus both old GPT 5.6 ids now silently serve 6.1 Sol), `openai/gpt-6-luna` (GPT 6 Luna, added 2026-09-23 — ~0.01 / 0.07 credits per 1k, the cheapest paid row), `openai/gpt-6-astra` (GPT 6 Astra, OpenAI's flagship, added 2026-09-05 — 2 / 7 credits per 1k, the priciest row; the proxy serves every GPT 6 model over OpenAI's Responses API, which is what lets Astra call function tools at all), `google/gemini-3.8-flash` (Gemini 3.8 Flash, ~0.2 / 1 credits per 1k tokens — much cheaper than Opus 5.5; a normal paid-selectable model billed like any other, **and** the only id a free run zero-rates) — seven models; treat that as a snapshot, not an allowlist. This model also drives image / video-frame asset analysis, including key-subject localization. **On a free-tier run** (`auto-edit` / `clipping`, zero-balance user) only `google/gemini-3.8-flash` is zero-rated — the in-app picker locks itself to it, but the MCP path does not, so **you** must `set_main_ai_model` (or pass `mainAiModelName`) with that id or the render bills and 402s |

- **Read current model:** `read_project_settings` → `AI_MODEL.main_ai_model_name`.
- **Before Create Video:** When the user names Opus, Fable, GPT 6.1 Sol, GPT 6 Luna, GPT 6 Astra, Gemini 3.8 Flash, or a specific model id, call **`set_main_ai_model`** before **`trigger_create_video`** / **`generate_video`**, or pass **`mainAiModelName`** on **`trigger_create_video`** for a one-shot run (persists to disk first, matching the UI dropdown at generate time).
- **Live UI:** Patches go through `update-project-settings`; the open app reloads the dropdown from disk (unlike PromptBar text, the model selector rarely races with in-memory UI state).

### Animation Studio chat model

The Animation Studio modal has its **own** model picker (labels like `claude-opus-5`). It does **not** read `AI_MODEL.main_ai_model_name`.

| MCP | Role |
|---|---|
| `animation_studio_list_models` | Supported chat **`model`** ids for this build |
| `animation_studio_send_*` optional **`model`** | Per-call override; default **`anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`** |

**Allowed ids:** server-driven — `animation_studio_list_models` returns the live lineup (same `main_ai` catalog category as the PromptBar picker; at time of writing seven: Opus 5.5, Fable 5.1, Sonnet 5.5, GPT 6.1 Sol, GPT 6 Luna, GPT 6 Astra, Gemini 3.8 Flash). Call it and pass an id from the response rather than one from this page. **`anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`**, **`anthropic/claude-opus-4-7`** and **`anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`** are retired from the selector — use **`anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`** instead. (**`anthropic/claude-sonnet-5-5`** is the Sonnet in the selector since `0054` on 2026-09-28; `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` still resolves to it through a disabled legacy-alias row.) (The proxy still resolves `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` via a disabled legacy-alias catalog row so older saved projects keep working, but do not pass it for new work.) Full workflow: **`references/panel-workflows/animation-studio.md`** → *Model selection*.

### Project targeting rules (apply to every **project** workflow)

**Skip this section for headless single-asset edit tools** (`trim_video`, `crop_media`, etc.) — they only need `inputPath` and Shorz running. See **`references/headless-workflows/single-asset-edit.md`**.

1. If the user names a project, resolve it with `list_projects` and use it. If not found, follow rule 5.
2. If the user says "current / open / this project", use `get_current_open_project`.
3. If the user gives no project identity, prefer `get_current_open_project`; otherwise ask whether to use existing or create new. **Never auto-pick** when multiple candidates match.
4. If the requested workflow conflicts with the current `projectType`, **do not silently repurpose** — ask whether to continue in the current project or create/select a matching type.
5. Create a new project only when the user explicitly asks, when a named target is missing and they approve creation, or when they ask for clean separation.
6. Never run destructive project actions (`delete_project`) without explicit confirmation. Same for `delete_asset`, `delete_overlay_effect`, `remove_animation_studio_export`, `clear_animation_studio_exports`.

### Asset verification: project main media vs My Assets library

Two different things — agents mix them up. Pick the right one.

- **Project main / timeline media** (the path(s) synced from the main VIDEO lane — **only workflows that expose main VIDEO import**, see **Main VIDEO import** above — e.g. `auto-edit` montage clips, clipping’s long source, `text-to-video` with **`imported`** source media): read `read_project_settings` → `ASSET_PATHS.main_video_asset_paths`, verify with **`file_exists`**. **`avatar`** / **`podcast`** templates do **not** use this lane in the shipped UI — do not treat `main_video_asset_paths` as required for Create Video there. **`advertisement`** center on **`ADVERTISEMENT.*` image paths**, not timeline video. **`music-video`** has no main lane: its input is the song at **`MUSIC_VIDEO.music_video_audio_path`** — verify that path with **`file_exists`**, not `main_video_asset_paths`. There is **no** MCP tool that lists "the project's VIDEOS tab"; for clipping do not verify the source via `get_video_assets`.
- **My Assets library tabs** (cross-project inventory; AI-generated outputs, imports, downloads): use the per-tab `get_*_assets` tools or filtered **`query_my_assets`** as described in `references/panel-workflows/README.md` → *Library and cross-cutting MCP tools*.

### Removing imported project assets (Your Library)

When the user asks to **remove**, **clear**, or **delete** something from the project **Your Library** lanes (**VIDEO**, **BROLL**, **SOUND**, **MUSIC**), they usually mean **drop it from the project**, not erase the file from disk. Full tab mapping and steps: **`references/panel-workflows/your-library-assets.md`**.

| UI tab | `ASSET_PATHS` field | Clear entire lane |
|---|---|---|
| VIDEO (Import Main Assets) | `main_video_asset_paths` | `update_project_settings` → `{ ASSET_PATHS: { main_video_asset_paths: "" } }` |
| BROLL | `broll_video_asset_paths` | `… { broll_video_asset_paths: "" }` |
| SOUND (sound effects) | `audio_fx_asset_paths` | `… { audio_fx_asset_paths: "" }` |
| MUSIC | `music_asset_paths` | `… { music_asset_paths: "" }` |

- **Default tool:** **`update_project_settings`** on the matching field. Paths are **comma-separated**; to remove one file, read settings, split/filter/rejoin, then patch. **Do not** use `delete_asset` unless the user explicitly wants the **file deleted from disk** (destructive; confirm first).
- **UI parity:** In-app trash on a library card only updates project paths (same as clearing via MCP); it does not unlink the source file.
- **Not the same as:** `get_*_assets` / My Assets modal inventory (use `delete_asset` there only when user wants the library file gone). Playback outputs (`last_generated_final_video_for_playback_mode`, `playback_history_video_paths`) stay until changed separately.
- **VIDEO tab availability** depends on `projectType` — see *Main VIDEO import* above before clearing main video on `avatar` / `podcast` / etc.

## Required Workflow Rules

0. **Pre-flight: the app's requirements guard does NOT protect you**
   - Since 2026-08-19 the desktop UI blocks **Create Video** and names what is missing when a
     project cannot possibly render. That check lives in the PromptBar's submit handler
     (`frontend/src/utils/generationRequirements.ts`) — **`trigger_create_video` and
     `generate_video` bypass it entirely.** Over MCP you get the old behaviour: the render starts,
     burns time, and fails (or silently returns the user's own file). Verify these yourself before
     triggering a render:

     | Project type | Must be true before you trigger |
     |---|---|
     | `auto-edit` | ≥1 file in the main VIDEOS lane **and** PromptBar instructions **> 10 chars** (below that the auto-editor is skipped and the source is re-exported untouched) |
     | `clipping` | **exactly one** video in the main lane — zero or two+ both fail |
     | `avatar` | avatar image set **and** (script **> 10 chars** **or** saved audio). Either input alone is enough; the mode toggle does not invalidate the other |
     | `podcast` | script **> 10 chars** in `[Interviewer]`/`[Interviewee]` form **and BOTH** avatar images set |
     | `text-to-video` | script **≥ 50 chars** **or** saved speech audio; plus ≥1 imported main asset when `textToVideoSourceMedia` is `imported` |
     | `advertisement` | **at least one** of product image / character image (either alone is fine) |
     | `music-video` | a song set (`MUSIC_VIDEO.music_video_audio_path` non-empty) **and** that file exists (`file_exists`) — without it the render stops (`music_video_no_song`) |

   - These mirror the renderer's own guards, so treat them as hard preconditions rather than
     advice. Re-read a setting after writing it when the render depends on it (`read_project_settings`).

1. **Project targeting first**
   - Prefer `get_current_open_project` first (active UI project source of truth).
   - If no active project is set, call `list_projects` and ask user to choose existing vs approve creating new.
   - Use absolute paths from `get_projects_path` and returned project metadata.

2. **Safe setting edits**
   - Call `read_project_settings` when you need the full picture or before non-trivial decisions.
   - Persist nested changes with `update_project_settings`: pass only the `updates` object for keys/sections to change (objects merge recursively; scalars and arrays replace). Optional `unsetPaths` deletes keys by dot notation. The main process reads the file, merges, validates, and writes atomically—**do not** reintroduce a manual read→edit full blob→write loop for ordinary edits.
   - For `set_*_settings` tools, MCP now performs strict validation:
     - unknown keys are rejected
     - invalid enum/color values are rejected
     - numeric values are range-validated; out-of-bounds values are **rejected or clamped per tool** (for example `set_border_settings` **clamps** `borderWidth` to 1–100 and `borderAnimationDuration` to 1–5)

3. **Asynchronous operations**
   - **Video generation (`generate_video` / Create Video)** — Poll **`get_video_generation_status`** until `lastStatus` is terminal (`completed`, `completed_no_output`, `error`, `stopped`, etc.). That is the main tool for project renders.
   - **`fetch_app_events`** — Use **sparingly**: when the user **explicitly** wants the raw event/log stream, or when **`get_video_generation_status` is unclear** (stuck, unexpected state) and you need the IPC log lines to see what the UI would have seen. Not the default loop for “wait for video.”
   - **Social video downloads (`download_social_video`)** — async by default; poll **`get_social_video_download_status`** until `lastStatus` is `completed` or `error`. YouTube extraction alone regularly takes minutes, so the blocking `awaitCompletion: true` form is only safe for short clips.
   - **Social publishing (`social_publish`)** — async by default; the tool starts the job and returns immediately. Poll **`get_social_publish_status`** until `lastStatus` is terminal (`completed` | `error`); its `result` carries the same per-platform payload as the blocking form. Media upload alone routinely runs for minutes, so pass `awaitCompletion: true` only when the MCP client's tool-call timeout exceeds ~8 minutes. A per-platform `status: "publishing"` is NOT final — PostPeer pushes to the platform asynchronously and it can still fail (e.g. X video-length limits); keep polling **`social_get_post_status`** with the returned `id` until it reports `published` (success) or `failed` (carries `lastError`, credits auto-refunded).
   - **All other long-running tools — async by default, poll `get_job_status`.** `generate_scene_image`, `generate_image_to_video`, `generate_images`, `edit_image_with_ai`, `remove_silence`, `transcribe_video_file`, `generate_tts_preview`, `generate_music`, `generate_sound_effect`, `remotion_render`, `x_search`, `youtube_upload_video`, `youtube_upload_from_local_file`, `download_generated_video`, `download_generated_music`, and `animation_studio_send_message` / `_send_and_compile` / `_send_compile_export` each return `{ started, jobId }` immediately. Poll **`get_job_status { jobId }`** every ~10–20s until `lastStatus` is `completed` (the `result` field holds the tool's full payload and `outputPaths` lists the absolute output files) or `error` (real error message in `error`). Pass `awaitCompletion: true` only when your tool-call timeout comfortably exceeds the tool's documented blocking window. **If a call or poll times out, the job is still running — NEVER blindly re-call the tool; paid generation would charge credits twice.** Jobs survive client-side timeouts but not an app restart.
   - **Other long-running work** (thumbnail creator UI flow) — follow each workflow; use `fetch_app_events` when those flows rely on IPC progress **and** the user cares about step-by-step output, or when debugging problems (see **Event stream**).
   - Report final completion/error to the user; use `fetch_app_events` for detail only when requested or when troubleshooting.

4. **Destructive actions**
   - Confirm user intent before `delete_project`, `delete_asset`, `delete_overlay_effect`,
     `remove_animation_studio_export`, or `clear_animation_studio_exports`.
   - **Removing a project library asset** (VIDEO/BROLL/SOUND/MUSIC) is usually **`update_project_settings`**, not `delete_asset` — see *Removing imported project assets* above.
   - For overlays, only imported/user overlays are deletable; default bundled overlays are protected.

5. **Keys and auth dependencies**
   - If provider features fail, check `read_api_keys`, balances, and auth status tools first.
   - For social posting, ensure account auth is active before upload.
   - Paid generation runs on Shorz account credits — use `get_shorz_credits` to confirm the user is
     signed in and has balance. If not signed in, sign them in with `shorz_sign_in_send_code` then
     `shorz_sign_in_verify_code` (ask the user for the emailed code).
   - **Zero-balance exception — the free tier.** A signed-in user whose balance is effectively empty
     (under 10 credits) still gets **4 free renders per week** (resets Monday 00:00 UTC, no rollover)
     on **`auto-edit` and `clipping` only**. So a low balance is not automatically a blocker for those
     two types — but it *is* for `text-to-video`, `avatar`, `podcast`, `advertisement` and `music-video`, which are
     paid only. The lease is opened and settled by the Electron **main** process around every render,
     so an MCP-triggered `trigger_create_video` / `generate_video` is covered exactly like the in-app
     Create Video button. A failed, stopped, or empty render does **not** consume one of the 4.
     (Unrelated to a desktop build that predates the tier: there the lease simply
     never opens and every call bills as before — a 402 on a zero-balance `auto-edit` render means
     this build, or the kill switch, not a mistake on your side.)
   - **Two things the app does for its own UI but NOT for you — do them yourself before a free render:**
     1. **Pin the model.** A free run zero-rates chat on **`google/gemini-3.8-flash`** and nothing else;
        any other model bills and 402s part-way through the render. The PromptBar pins it for
        button-started renders, but nothing pins it on the MCP path — call **`set_main_ai_model`** (or
        pass `mainAiModelName` on `trigger_create_video`) with `google/gemini-3.8-flash` first.
     2. **Check the source length.** Free runs cap the source at **30 minutes**. The renderer sends the
        probed duration so the proxy can refuse before the render starts; the MCP bridge does not send
        it, so an over-long source is **not** refused up front — probe with `get_media_info` and honour
        the cap yourself. Per-run abuse ceilings still apply server-side (6h lease, 400 LLM calls, 3M
        tokens, 5400 transcription seconds); tripping one ends the zero-rating mid-render, and the
        render then bills — i.e. 402s — from that point on.
   - **What a free run covers — the allowlist IS the paid boundary** (there is no second enforcement
     path): main-AI chat on the pinned model (plus a cheap analysis-tier Gemini id that a few pipeline
     steps hardcode — nothing for you to set), ElevenLabs **transcription**, and **web-image search**
     (the WEB B-roll source). Everything else bills normally inside a free run and therefore **402s at
     zero balance**. Free in a render: the LLM edit itself, local effects (cuts, filler-word/silence
     removal, zooms, face tracking, freeze frame, video colors), subtitles, titles, borders, overlays,
     **Auto SoundFX** (it places bundled sound files, no provider call), **four of the five B-roll
     sources — Assets, WEB, GIF and EMOJI** — and saving or exporting the finished file.
     Not free (do **not** enable or queue these for a zero-balance user):
     AI B-roll (`set_broll_settings.automaticAiBroll`, image *or* video), dubbing and auto-music and
     noise removal (`set_audio_settings`), thumbnail generation (`thumbnail_creator_generate`),
     Animation Studio chat (`animation_studio_send_*` — compiling/exporting an already-built animation
     is local and stays free), every standalone generation tool (`generate_images`,
     `generate_scene_image`, `generate_image_to_video`, `edit_image_with_ai`,
     `proxy_aiml_video_generation`, `generate_tts_preview`), `x_search`, and publishing
     (`social_publish`, `youtube_upload_*` — connecting an account is not itself billed, but the
     in-app Connect buttons are gated for these users, so don't promise a publish they can't pay for).
     **No silent-degradation cases:** everything on the free list above works in full on a free run —
     the only paid B-roll source is the **AI** tab, and every other lock above fails loudly with a 402
     rather than quietly dropping content from the finished video.
   - **Out of runs or out of credits?** There is no MCP purchase tool. Tell the user to buy credits in
     the app (**Buy Credits** opens Stripe Checkout in their **default browser**; the wallet is
     credited server-side and the app polls the balance), or to wait for the Monday 00:00 UTC reset.

## Tool Families

**Media always comes back as a file path, never base64.** No Shorz tool returns a data URL or a raw
base64 blob: generated and rendered media is written to disk and the response carries the absolute
path (`savedLocalFilePaths`, `pngFilePath`, `audioFilePath`, `outputPath`, `filePath`). Read that path
to inspect the file, or pass it straight to any tool that takes a local path. If a payload ever does
arrive inline, the server writes it to `%TEMP%\shorz-mcp-media\` and substitutes the path, appending a
note that names the extracted files — so a path is always what you act on.

### App and Configuration
- `check_for_update`
- `get_resource_path`
- `open_file_directory`, `file_exists`, `get_local_file_size`
- `read_api_keys`, `validate_elevenlabs_api_key`
- `get_elevenlabs_balance` (BYO ElevenLabs key balance; AIMLAPI key/license tools retired — paid generation runs on Shorz credits via the proxy)

### Shorz Account (credits + sign-in)
- `get_shorz_credits` — Shorz credit balance + entitlement for the signed-in user. Errors if no one is
  signed in or the credit server is unreachable. Check this before running paid generation tools. A
  balance under 10 credits means the free tier may apply — see *Keys and auth dependencies* below.
  The reply still carries a legacy **`watermark_free`** field: it is a deprecated alias for
  `has_purchased` and says nothing about exports. **Shorz watermarks nothing, at any tier** — never
  report that field to the user or treat it as an entitlement.
- `get_shorz_usage_and_pricing` — current model costs + recent usage for the signed-in user (same data
  as the in-app Usage & Pricing window): balance, recent calls, and per-model credit pricing. All
  amounts are in the credits the user pays (markup already included; never exposes our cost or markup).
  Free-tier renders appear in `recent_calls` as their own rows — `operation` reads
  **"Free run · Auto edit"** / **"Free run · Clipping"**, `units` shows the token spend, and `credits`
  is **0** (the in-app Usage tab renders those rows as "Free"). They carry `type: "addition"` as a
  quirk of the shared mapping — nothing was added; report them as free runs, not as credit grants.
- `shorz_sign_in_send_code` (email) → `shorz_sign_in_verify_code` (email + code) — email-OTP sign-in,
  identical to the in-app Sign-in button. Step 1 emails a one-time code; ask the user for it, then
  pass it (the 6–10 digit, usually 8-digit, value) to step 2. The Shorz desktop app must be running.

### Projects and Settings
- `create_project` (`projectType`: `auto-edit` \| `clipping` \| `text-to-video` \| `avatar` \| `podcast` \| `advertisement` \| `music-video` — hyphenated; anything else is rejected), `list_projects`, `delete_project`, `get_current_open_project`
- `read_project_settings`, `update_project_settings`
- `set_user_instructions` (PromptBar creative brief), `set_main_ai_model` (PromptBar main LLM)
- `switch_project_aspect_ratio` (directly updates `VIDEO_SIZE` width/height + optional fps)
- Direct panel settings tools:
  - `set_subtitle_settings`
  - `set_title_settings`
  - `set_border_settings`
  - `set_overlay_settings`
  - `set_audio_settings`
  - `set_audio_visualization_settings`
  - `set_broll_settings`
  - `set_text_to_video_settings`
  - `set_avatar_settings`
  - `set_podcast_settings`
  - `set_advertisement_settings`
  - `set_music_video_settings`
  - `set_general_video_settings`
- Panel styling and “looks” are applied only via granular `set_*_settings` (and project settings read/update); there are no MCP preset shortcut tools.

### Generation and Rendering
- `generate_video`, `stop_video_generation`, `get_video_generation_status` (primary status for project renders), `fetch_app_events` (IPC log stream; optional `since` cursor), `render_text_preview`
- `compile_remotion_preview`, `remotion_render`
- `proxy_aiml_video_generation`
- `generate_images` (standalone AIML image generation to library paths; no Thumbnail Creator modal). Optional `referenceImages` (up to 3 face/subject photos) preserve the **same face/identity** — the headless equivalent of the Avatar Creator modal's face-reference picker; use it to generate an avatar or podcast host that must look like a specific person.
- **Standalone generation assets (no project / no Create Video):**
  - `generate_scene_image` — Python text-to-video image stack (`Nano Banana 2`, `GPT Image 2` — the `GPT Image 2` id now serves GPT Image 2.5 — optional reference paths). Explicit `aspectRatio` or `width`/`height`. Does **not** read or write `SCRTIPT_TO_VIDEO`.
  - `generate_image_to_video` — Python i2v stack; requires `imagePath`, `prompt`, and explicit `videoModel` (same ids as `textToVideoVideoModel`). Optional `durationSec` (**rejected with an error if outside the per-model range** — Gemini Omni 1–10, Seedance 2.5 4–30, Seedance 2.0 family 4–15, Kling 3–15; omitted → 8), `aspectRatio` (**`16:9` or `9:16` ONLY, default `9:16`** — **1:1 is retired for video generation** and is rejected, even though standalone *image* generation still accepts it) or explicit dimensions, `generateAudio`. Does **not** run a project timeline.
  - Use these to produce library assets; use `import_frontend_assets` / project workflows when assembling a full video. **Do not** substitute these for `trigger_create_video` on text-to-video, avatar, or podcast projects.
  - Prefer `generate_scene_image` over `generate_images` for text-to-video parity (typed character/environment/style reference roles, exact TTV export dimensions). For **avatar / podcast face preservation** (keep a specific person's face), use `generate_images` with `referenceImages`. Prefer `generate_image_to_video` over `proxy_aiml_video_generation` for Shorz model routing (Gemini Omni native route, Seedance, Kling).
  - **Credits:** both tools call paid providers; invoke only when the user explicitly wants generation.
  - **Async by default:** `generate_scene_image`, `generate_image_to_video`, and `generate_images` return `{ started, jobId }` immediately — poll `get_job_status` (see rule 3 in **Required Workflow Rules**). Same for `remotion_render` and the `animation_studio_send_*` tools.
- `generate_music` — **text-to-music** into the generated-audio library (headless twin of the Music
  Generation panel). Two AIML models via the proxy: **`elevenlabs/eleven_music`** (default) honours
  `musicLengthMs` **10000–300000** and bills **~20 credits per MINUTE**, so cost scales with length;
  **`google/lyria2`** is a flat **~2 credits per generation**, picks its own length (**measured ~32.8s**)
  and **ignores `musicLengthMs`**. Use Lyria 2 for cheap loop/bed material, ElevenLabs Music when the
  track must match an exact duration. Async by default — poll `get_job_status`; the result is
  `{ success, path, newBalance }` with an absolute audio path whose extension matches the real
  container — **`.mp3` for eleven_music, `.wav` for Lyria 2** (48kHz PCM). Prompt instrumental-only when a voice-over
  sits on top. Distinct from render-time **auto-music** (`set_audio_settings`), which generates inside
  Create Video instead.
- `generate_sound_effect` — **one sound effect from a text description** (ElevenLabs sound generation,
  routed through the Shorz proxy on **Shorz credits**; a BYO ElevenLabs key is never used here — the same
  engine Auto SoundFX uses inside a render). `text` **3–450 chars**, optional `durationSeconds`
  **0.5–22** (default **1**) — match it to the motion it scores. One call per distinct cue (whoosh for a
  panel wipe, soft UI click, keyboard ticks, riser into a reveal, sub impact on a logo hit). Describe the
  sound physically and briefly (`'short airy whoosh, left to right, 0.4s, clean, no reverb tail'`) —
  material, speed and length beat film or brand names. For free CC0 library sounds search
  `openverse_search_sound_effects` first; generate when you need an exact length or a sound that does not
  exist. Async by default — poll `get_job_status`; the result is `{ success, path, newBalance }` with an
  absolute **`.mp3`** in the generated-audio library, ready for `import_frontend_assets` (assetType
  `'sound'`) or an Animation Studio `audioReferences` entry.
- `thumbnail_creator_generate`, `get_thumbnail_creator_generation_status`
- `animation_studio_list_models`, `animation_studio_send_message`
- `animation_studio_send_and_compile`
- `get_job_status` (generic poll for every async-by-default background job)

### Assets and Library
- Read/list: `get_my_videos`, `get_video_assets`, `get_image_assets`, `get_generated_thumbnails`,
  `get_audio_assets`, `get_downloaded_gifs`, `get_downloaded_images`, `get_available_fonts`
- Filtered search (multi-tab): `query_my_assets`
- **My Assets usage (not project-specific):** Library listing and search work whenever the user wants to inspect files (no open project required). Prefer **`query_my_assets`** when searching by name, date, or multiple tabs; use per-tab **`get_*`** for a full single-tab list. Fields, limits, and filter semantics: **`references/panel-workflows/README.md`** → *Library and cross-cutting MCP tools* → *Search and list My Assets*.
- Modify/import/export:
  - `import_frontend_assets` (`assetType`: `video` \| `broll` \| `sound` \| `music` \| `image` \| `avatar` \| `audio`; optional `overridePaths`) — **`assetType: "video"`** is main timeline / **Import Main Assets**; **only where the UI exposes it** (see **Main VIDEO import** above) — headless `overridePaths` imports into lane-disabled projects are **rejected with an error**. With **`overridePaths`**, library lanes (`video`/`broll`/`sound`/`music`/`audio`) validate, persist to **`ASSET_PATHS`**, and refresh Your Library in one call, returning `{ importedCount, imported[], skippedCount, skipped[], … }` — files whose name the lane already holds are **skipped, not added** (see **One asset per file name** above); read `skippedCount` before reporting success. **`image`/`avatar`** return metadata only — use typed panel tools to assign.
  - `rename_asset`, `delete_asset`, `save_file_as`,
  `save_image_data_as`, `download_generated_music`, `save_generated_sound_effect`,
  `download_generated_image`, `download_generated_thumbnail`, `download_generated_video`,
  `download_social_video` (**async by default** — returns immediately; poll
  **`get_social_video_download_status`** until `lastStatus` is `completed` or `error`.
  Pass `awaitCompletion: true` only for short clips: YouTube extraction alone routinely
  runs several minutes and will blow past the MCP request timeout.)
  - `download_generated_video` and `download_generated_music` are also **async by default**
    (large CDN files) — they return `{ started, jobId }`; poll **`get_job_status`**.
    Image/thumbnail downloads stay synchronous.

### Text-to-Video / Avatar Media Helpers
- `list_elevenlabs_voices`, `generate_tts_preview` (**async by default** — poll `get_job_status`; the completed `result` is `{ success, audioFilePath, mimeType, bytes, newBalance }` and the clip is a real file on disk. **Spends credits**, and a few thousand characters of narration render for minutes — never re-call it after a timeout, poll instead. Split long scripts into ~2,500-char chunks and re-join the mp3s with `concat_media`), `transcribe_video_file` (**async by default** — poll `get_job_status`; long footage transcribes for minutes)
- `save_avatar_image`, `save_avatar_audio`, `delete_avatar_audio`
- `save_text_to_video_speech_audio`, `delete_text_to_video_speech_audio`
- `save_text_to_video_reference_images`, `delete_text_to_video_reference_image`
- `select_local_image_for_import` (native file dialog; interactive — returns `{ success, filePath, fileName, canceled }`, the absolute path of the file the user picked; see `references/project-workflows/text-to-video.md`)

### Headless single-asset edits (no project)
- **Not tied to any `projectType`.** Operate on one local file via `inputPath`; optional `outputPath` for a stable save location.
- Tools: `trim_video`, `remove_ranges`, `remove_audio`, `set_audio_volume`, `change_video_speed`, `set_image_duration`, `rotate_media`, `flip_media`, `reverse_video`, `loop_video`, `fade_video`, `freeze_frame`, `crop_media`, `audio_fade`, `remove_silence`, `edit_image_with_ai`, `get_media_info`, `resize_media`, `fit_to_aspect`, `extract_audio`, `replace_audio`, `concat_media`, `extract_video_frames`
- Workflow: **`references/headless-workflows/single-asset-edit.md`**. Chain edits by passing each `outputPath` as the next `inputPath`. Do not substitute Create Video or an `auto-edit` project for a simple trim/crop request.

### Editing an already rendered auto-edit video (text instruction → new version)
- **`edit_generated_video { projectPath, videoPath, instruction }`** — one plain-language change to a video Create Video already produced ("cut 0:05-0:08", "swap the second and third clip", "remove the zoom near the start", "make the subtitles bigger", "add a zoom when I say launch", "turn the music down"). Works on auto-edit videos and on text-to-video stories made from generated images or AI clips (scene edits: "give scene 3 a different picture", "change what scene 2 says to …", "remove scene 4", "use a deeper voice", "dissolve between every scene"). Interprets the instruction into validated operations on the video's saved render plan (`<video>.plan.json`, written by every such render) and REPLAYS the render with every other AI decision pinned — nothing else changes, generated b-roll/GIFs/images and a story's narration, pictures and clips are reused, not re-billed. Produces a NEW versioned mp4 (the original stays), updates `last_generated_final_video_for_playback_mode`, and remembers the conversation per video. Async by default (poll `get_job_status`). `status`: `rendered` | `clarify` (answer the question with another call on the SAME `videoPath`) | `unsupported` | `failed` | `busy`. Videos rendered before this feature have no plan file → `unsupported`: create the video again first. Never use it to *create* a video, and never re-run `trigger_create_video` to "tweak" a finished one when this tool can.
- Workflow: **`references/project-workflows/edit-generated-video.md`**. The same editor exists in the app as the **Edit** pill over the PLAYBACK video.

### Headless project file pickers (local paths)

- Avatar: `select_avatar_image`, `select_avatar_angle_image`, `select_avatar_audio` → `references/project-workflows/avatar.md`
- Podcast avatars: `select_podcast_avatar_image` → `references/project-workflows/podcast.md`
- Advertisement images: `select_advertisement_image`, `remove_advertisement_image` → `references/project-workflows/advertisement.md`
- Music video song + artist image: `select_music_video_audio`, `remove_music_video_audio`, `select_music_video_character_image`, `remove_music_video_character_image` (take `filePath`, copy by path; `projectPath` defaults to the open music-video project) → `references/project-workflows/music-video.md`

### Overlay and Animation Studio
- `get_overlay_effects`, `import_overlay_effects`, `delete_overlay_effect`
- `get_animation_studio_exports`, `remove_animation_studio_export`,
  `clear_animation_studio_exports`

### Canvas (node-graph video builder)
- `canvas_list`, `canvas_get` — read canvases (free; opens nothing).
- `canvas_build` — create a canvas or add to one from `{ name, nodes, edges }` (the Build with AI
  JSON shape) plus `updates` for existing nodes. Strict and all-or-nothing; opens Canvas so the
  user watches. Free.
- `canvas_remove` — delete nodes (with their wires) and wires; `canvas_build`'s `remove` field does the
  same inside one all-or-nothing edit, so rewiring is a single call.
- `canvas_run` — runs only out-of-date nodes and returns the Export node's `outputPath`. **Two-step
  spend:** a paid plan returns the estimate and runs nothing until you call again with
  `maxCredits` ≥ the estimate — show the user that number first. Async: poll `get_job_status`.
- `canvas_stop` — stop the running canvas (like the Stop button; in-flight generations finish and
  are kept, the run's job ends with `stopped: true`). `canvas_rename`, `canvas_delete` (only when the
  user asked; moves the file to `Canvas/.trash`, media stays). None of the three opens Canvas.
- `canvas_pick_take` — choose a node's take (number, 1 = oldest, or id from `canvas_get` `takeList`);
  downstream becomes out of date. `canvas_duplicate` — copy a canvas with every take (branching).
  Neither opens Canvas.
- Full contract, node catalog and examples: **`references/panel-workflows/canvas.md`**.

### Social Publishing
- YouTube (native): `youtube_auth_status`, `youtube_auth_start`, `youtube_remove_account`,
  `youtube_sign_out`, `youtube_upload_video`, `youtube_upload_from_local_file`
- **Custom YouTube thumbnails:** both upload tools — and `social_publish`'s youtube entry (or its
  top-level `thumbnailSrc`) — accept optional **`thumbnailSrc`** (local image path), set via
  `thumbnails.set` right after the upload and auto re-encoded/downscaled under YouTube's 2MB cap.
  A thumbnail failure never fails the upload: the result stays `success:true` with
  `thumbnail:{set:false,error}` plus a `warning`. A **403 means the channel isn't phone-verified**
  (YouTube gates custom thumbnails on verification) — don't retry; verify at youtube.com/verify or
  set it in Studio.
- TikTok / Instagram / Facebook / X / LinkedIn / Threads / Pinterest: connect and publish via the unified `social_*` tools
  (`social_connect_account`, `social_publish`, `social_list_scheduled`, `social_disconnect_account`, …),
  routed through PostPeer. (YouTube can also publish/schedule via `social_publish`.)
- **Where `accountId` comes from:** `social_publish` requires an `accountId` per non-YouTube platform — get it
  from **`social_list_connections`** (returns `accountId`, `displayName`, `status` per connected account;
  `refresh: true` re-syncs from PostPeer). For YouTube use `youtube_auth_status` instead (it yields `channelId`).
  Board ids for Pinterest come from `social_get_posting_options`.
- **Quote the cost before publishing:** **`social_estimate_publish_cost`** (`platforms[]`, plus
  `xCaptionHasLink: true` when the X caption contains a URL) returns the server-priced credit breakdown.
  Prices are **not** uniform — **X costs ~5× the base rate, and ~50× when the caption carries a link**;
  every other platform including LinkedIn / Threads / Pinterest bills at the base rate. A multi-platform
  publish is one fan-out but **N separate charges**, so estimate first rather than assuming one post = one charge.
- **Every publish costs credits**, on both routes (`social_publish` bills per platform; the native
  YouTube upload is billed after the upload lands). The free tier does **not** cover publishing, so a
  zero-balance user cannot post even from a free render's output — connecting an account is not itself
  billed, but the in-app Connect buttons are gated for those users, so don't set up a publish they
  can't complete. `social_refresh_analytics` stays free.

### Event stream (`fetch_app_events`)

**When to use (project video):** Prefer **`get_video_generation_status`**. Call **`fetch_app_events`** only if the user asks for live logs/progress, or when **debugging** video creation (hangs, errors, stalls) and you need raw `video-generation-log` / channel traffic. Pass optional **`since`** (ms timestamp) to poll incrementally.

The bridge records **every** `mainWindow.webContents.send(...)` from the Electron main process to the renderer (ring buffer, latest ~2000 entries). **`fetch_app_events`** exposes that buffer over MCP; it is **not** limited to video generation.

- **Shape**: Each entry is `{ channel, args, timestamp }` where `timestamp` is a Unix ms clock value when the send occurred.
- **Args are summarized, not verbatim**: the log answers *what happened*, so long strings, long arrays and oversized payloads are recorded as markers (`[omitted image/png data URL, 1953.1 KB]`, `[+480 more items omitted]`). Read the settings or asset tools for full values; `fetch_app_events` is for channel traffic and log lines.
- **Incremental polling**: Pass optional `since` (number). The bridge returns events with **`timestamp` strictly greater than `since`**. After each response, set `since` to the **largest `timestamp` in that batch** (or the latest event you processed) so the next call returns only newer sends. This is a **time cursor**, not a sequential event index.
- **Typical channels during work** (non-exhaustive): `video-generation-state`, `video-generation-log` (callback log lines during `generate-video`), `youtube-upload-progress`, `social-publish-progress`, `remotion-render-progress`, `mcp-activity` (after MCP invoke calls complete), `animation-studio-mcp-workflow`, `thumbnail-creator-generation-state`, and routine UI traffic such as `window-state-changed`.
- **Idle / no active generation**: The tool still succeeds; batches may be empty or contain **unrelated** IPC from normal UI activity. Do not expect `video-generation-log` entries unless generation (or another feature emitting those channels) is actually running.
- **Completeness**: For whether generation finished, failed, or was stopped, **`get_video_generation_status`** is authoritative for projects. Use `fetch_app_events` to supplement, not replace, when diagnosing.

## Frontend Parity Guidance

- **Header menu**
  - API keys/license/update map to app/config tools where exposed over MCP. Opening external URLs (pricing, privacy, etc.) uses in-app IPC only, not MCP.
- **Project manager modal**
  - Create/list/delete/open behavior maps to project tools.
- **Panel option controls (Text-to-video, Avatar, Advertisement, Music Video, Settings, Border, Text, Audio, B-roll)**
  - Prefer direct tools (`set_*_settings`) for panel-level updates.
  - Static options are now defined in MCP input schemas via enums (no separate "list options" tool needed for fixed values).
  - Dynamic values still come from listing tools, e.g. `list_elevenlabs_voices`, `get_available_fonts`, social auth/account tools.
  - `set_border_settings` accepts `border` (toggle; matches the Border panel), optional legacy `borderActive` if `border` is omitted, plus `borderWidth`, `borderColor1/2`, `borderAnimation`, `borderAnimationDuration`.
  - `borderWidth` is clamped to **1–100**; `borderAnimationDuration` is clamped to **1–5** (matches Border panel sliders).
  - `borderAnimation` supports: `None`, `Fade`, `Circular`, `Moving Circles`, `Hypnotizing Grid`, `Wave`, `Grain`, `Scratches`, `Blink`, `Full Color Spectrum`.
  - Over MCP, `borderAnimation` must use those **exact** enum strings (case-sensitive at the tool boundary); invalid values fail validation with the allowed list. Server-side normalization applies only after a value passes MCP input validation.
  - `set_text_to_video_settings` static enums include:
    - `textToVideoInputMode`: `script` | `audio`
    - `textToVideoSourceMedia`: `imported` | `generated_images` | `generated_video`
    - `textToVideoTransitionType` / `textToVideoTransitionTypes`: `none`, `automatic`, `fade`, `dissolve`, `fadeblack`, `fadewhite`, `fadegrays`, `wipeleft`, `wiperight`, `wipeup`, `wipedown`, `slideleft`, `slideright`, `slideup`, `slidedown`, `smoothleft`, `smoothright`, `smoothup`, `smoothdown`, `revealleft`, `revealright`, `revealup`, `revealdown`, `circleopen`, `circleclose`, `circlecrop`, `radial`, `pixelize`, `distance`, `hrslice`, `hlslice`, `squeezeh`, `zoomin`, `hblur`
    - `textToVideoImageMotion` / `textToVideoImageMotions`: `none`, `ai`, `zoom_out`, `zoom_in`, `zoom_in_left`, `zoom_in_right`, `zoom_in_top`, `zoom_in_bottom`, `random_zoom`, `rapid_zoom`, `pan_left`, `pan_right`, `pan_up`, `pan_down`, `handheld_camera`, `rotation`
    - `textToVideoImageModel`: `Nano Banana 2`, `GPT Image 2` (= GPT Image 2.5 Flare, fast), `GPT Image 2.5 Sunburst` (sharper, a few seconds slower, same 2 credits) (Nano Banana 2 Lite is not a TTV option — it stays for AI B-roll and standalone generate_images)
    - `textToVideoVideoModel`: `bytedance/seedance-2-0-mini` (the server catalog default for `text_to_video`, and the cheapest at ~9 cr/s @720p), `klingai/video-v3-standard-image-to-video` (3–15s clips, ~26 cr/s), `gemini-omni-flash-preview` (native Google route, token-billed ~12 cr/s), `bytedance/seedance-2-5` (premium: 4–30s in ONE generation, 480p/720p, ~27 cr/s), `bytedance/seedance-2-0`, `bytedance/seedance-2-0-fast`. **Do not assume a persisted default** — the on-disk value varies by how the project was created; read it with `read_project_settings` and set it explicitly with `set_text_to_video_settings`. **Retired, do not send:** `google/veo-3.1-i2v-fast` (rejected on write) and `custom:happyhorse-1.0` (**passes MCP validation**, but its catalog row is disabled, so the write succeeds and the render then fails at generation time)
  - `set_music_video_settings` — `videoModel` / `imageModel` are **live catalog ids, not enums** (the `text_to_video` rows — the same models as Text-to-Video); an unknown or disabled id is rejected with the current list, and a new `videoModel` also stores its per-clip range. `cutPace`: `auto` | `relaxed` | `energetic`; `sectionTransitions`, `useFullSong` booleans; `rangeStartSec` / `rangeEndSec` seconds (`0` end = to the end of the song); `lipSync` boolean (a few AI-picked sung moments become close-ups lip-synced to the song) with `lipSyncModel` `Kling Avatar Pro` | `Kling Avatar` | `OmniHuman 1.5`. Full contract: `references/project-workflows/music-video.md`.
  - `set_text_to_video_settings` also accepts:
    - `textToVideoScript`: string
    - `textToVideoVoice`: string (typically an ElevenLabs voice id/name)
    - `textToVideoReferenceImagePaths`: `string[]` (local/URL image references)
  - `set_general_video_settings` Auto Zoom usage:
    - `zoomType: "Intelligent Auto Zoom"`: uses `zoomCount`, `zoomStrength`, `zoomSpeed`, `zoomInEffects`, `zoomOutEffects` (non-empty string arrays; allowed ids in `references/panel-workflows/settings.md`). Legacy `zoomInEffect` / `zoomOutEffect` single strings still accepted (+ `autoZoom` on this tool; `zoomSounds` on `set_audio_settings`).
    - `zoomType: "Zoom on Music Beat"`: UI exposes a reduced set; keep `autoZoom` / `zoomSounds` / `zoomType` primary and avoid assuming all Intelligent Auto Zoom tuning controls are active in this mode.
  - Title manual-only controls: `titleStartTime`, `titleDuration` (with `titlePlacement: Manual`).
  - **Title inline emojis (optional):** `titleText` may include standard Unicode emoji (e.g. `🔥`, `⭐`); they render inline in export and Editor preview when present. Plain text titles need no emoji and no extra MCP flag. Distinct from B-roll **`automaticEmojis`** (timed PNG overlays via `set_broll_settings`).
  - **Title/subtitle position:** `titlePositionX` / `subtitlePositionX` are horizontal **center** %; `titlePositionY` / `subtitlePositionY` are **top edge** %. Export and preview **clamp** so the measured text box stays inside ~2% frame insets — raw **100%** horizontal may clamp inward for wide titles. UI Position presets use measured text size; wait for metrics before relying on corner presets.
  - **Title text alignment (titles only):** `titleAlignment` (`left`/`center`/`right`, default `center`, persisted as `title_alignment`) aligns wrapped lines **inside** the title block — visible only when `titleMaxWordsPerLine` wraps the headline, and it does **not** move the block (that is `titlePositionX`/`titlePositionY`). The subtitle twin `subtitleAlignment` is still validated-then-dropped, so do not assume symmetry.
  - **B-roll overlay position:** same center-X / top-Y % model for fit-mode **Assets** (`brollPositionX`/`brollPositionY`), **Web** (`webImagesPositionX`/`webImagesPositionY`), **GIF** (`gifPositionX`/`gifPositionY`), and **AI** (`aiBrollPositionX`/`aiBrollPositionY`). Fullscreen assets ignore position. Legacy preset keys on disk migrate on load; MCP patches should use `*PositionX`/`*PositionY`. See **`references/panel-workflows/broll.md`**.
  - Title/subtitle stroke width inputs are validated to a minimum of `1` when enabled (`0` is only valid in disable flows).
  - `set_broll_settings` — full contract in **`references/panel-workflows/broll.md`**. Summary:
    - **Transitions:** every B-roll type has a separate entrance pool (`*TransitionAnimations`) and exit pool (`*TransitionOutAnimations`), same id set; exit plays the effect reversed as the asset leaves. Both default to `["None"]`.
    - **Assets:** `fullscreenBRoll`, `brollPositionX`/`brollPositionY` (`0..100`, fit only), `brollFitWidthPercent` (`30..100`, fit only), `brollTransitionAnimations`, `brollTransitionOutAnimations`, `brollTransitionDuration` (`0.2..1.0`, applies to in+out; only when transitions ≠ `None`)
    - **Web:** `automaticWebImages`, `webImagesTransitionAnimations`, `webImagesTransitionOutAnimations` + `webImagesAnimationDuration` (in+out; only when transitions ≠ `None`), `webImagesCount` `1..30`, `webImagesSize` `100..1920`, `webImagesPositionX`/`webImagesPositionY` `0..100` (each web image's on-screen time is derived from the transcript, not a setting — steer via prompt)
    - **GIF:** `automaticGifs`, `gifType`, `gifCount`, `gifPositionX`/`gifPositionY` `0..100`, `gifWidthPercent` `30..100`, `gifTransitionAnimations`, `gifTransitionOutAnimations`
    - **AI:** `automaticAiBroll`, `aiBrollType` (`"image"` stills or `"video"` text-to-video clips), `aiBrollImageModel` / `aiBrollVideoModel` (server-catalog ids, project type `broll` — e.g. `"Nano Banana 2"`, `"Nano Banana 2 Lite"`, `"GPT Image 2"` (= GPT Image 2.5 Flare), `"GPT Image 2.5 Sunburst"` / `"bytedance/seedance-2-0-fast"`, `"bytedance/seedance-2-0-mini"`, `"bytedance/seedance-2-5"`, `"klingai/video-v3-standard-text-to-video"`), `aiBrollCount`, `aiBrollPositionX`/`aiBrollPositionY` `0..100`, `aiBrollWidthPercent`, `aiBrollTransitionAnimations`, `aiBrollTransitionOutAnimations`. Video clip length is decided by the AI from speech timing (clamped to the model's range) — there is no length setting, and video mode costs far more than image mode.
    - **Emoji:** `automaticEmojis`, `emojiSounds`, `emojiCount`, `emojiAnimations`, `emojiPositionX`, `emojiPositionY`, `emojiSize`
    - **B-roll sounds (separate tool):** `set_audio_settings.imageSounds` for assets/web/gif/ai appearance SFX
  - Use `switch_project_aspect_ratio` for preview aspect ratio changes (`16:9`, `1:1`, `9:16`).
  - Fallback to `read_project_settings` + `update_project_settings` for unsupported edge keys (still pass only the nested keys you need in `updates`).
- **Thumbnail Creator**
  - Use `set_thumbnail_creator_settings` to patch draft state and `thumbnail_creator_generate` for one-call generation (default async: omit `awaitCompletion` or pass `false`, then poll `get_thumbnail_creator_generation_status` until `isGenerating` is false).
  - `referenceImages` and `youtubeReferenceUrl` remain persisted in draft across model switches.
  - `referenceImages` and `youtubeReferenceUrl` are consumed by **both** models: Nano Banana via `image_urls`, and GPT Image 2.5 via OpenAI image edits. (`youtubeReferenceUrl` applies in `16:9`.)
- **My Assets and Library**
  - Listing/search: see **Assets and Library** above and **`references/panel-workflows/README.md`** (*Search and list My Assets*). Import/download/delete/rename/save: same tool family as in **Assets and Library**.
- **Overlay panel**
  - Use `get_overlay_effects`, `import_overlay_effects`, `delete_overlay_effect`.
- **Animation Studio**
  - Use `references/panel-workflows/animation-studio.md` as the primary workflow reference.
  - For low-level/manual control, `compile_remotion_preview` and `remotion_render` remain available.
- **Social publishing**
  - YouTube (native): authenticate first, then upload. Prefer `youtube_upload_from_local_file` for headless runs: pass a disk path, resolve the account with `channelId` or `channelTitle`. Low-level `youtube_upload_video` remains available for full control. Both take optional **`thumbnailSrc`** (local image path) — set as the custom thumbnail via `thumbnails.set` after the upload, auto-fitted under YouTube's 2MB cap; a thumbnail failure never fails the upload (result carries `thumbnail:{set:false,error}` + `warning`; 403 = channel not phone-verified, don't retry). Schemas constrain **`privacy`** to `public` | `private` | `unlisted` and **`category`** to the same fixed names as the Electron `YOUTUBE_CATEGORY_IDS` map (optional; default category id 24 if omitted). Both upload tools are **async by default** — they return `{ started, jobId }`; poll `get_job_status` until `completed`/`error` (`awaitCompletion: true` blocks, needs a tool-call timeout >= 8 minutes).
  - TikTok / Instagram / Facebook / X / LinkedIn / Threads / Pinterest: connect with `social_connect_account`, then publish or schedule with `social_publish` (routed through PostPeer; charges Shorz credits per platform). Media is optional — `social_publish` accepts a **video**, an **image**, or **no media (text-only)** via `mediaSrc` (a local path; `videoSrc` is an alias). Optional top-level `thumbnailSrc` (local image) becomes the video's thumbnail on the PostPeer platforms **and** the YouTube custom thumbnail (a `thumbnailSrc` on the youtube platform entry overrides it). Support by platform: text-only → X / LinkedIn / Facebook / Threads; image → X / LinkedIn / Facebook / Instagram / Threads / Pinterest; video → all. Instagram & Pinterest always need media; YouTube & TikTok need a video. LinkedIn posts to a personal profile or company page and accepts `platformSpecific:{ visibility:'public'|'connections' }` (defaults public). Threads accepts `platformSpecific:{ replyControl:'everyone'|'accounts_you_follow'|'mentioned_only' }` (defaults everyone; captions max 500 chars). TikTok accepts `platformSpecific:{ privacyLevel:'PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE'|'MUTUAL_FOLLOW_FRIENDS'|'SELF_ONLY' }` — TikTok **requires** a privacy level for a direct post, so the proxy defaults it to `PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE` when omitted; pass it explicitly to post privately, and check the account really offers that level via `social_get_posting_options` (`privacyLevelOptions`). TikTok also accepts `platformSpecific:{ draft:true }` to send the video to the TikTok inbox instead of posting it (the user must then open TikTok and tap Post; no privacy level applies). Note a TikTok rejection is **asynchronous** — it surfaces ~90s after the slot, never at create time, so always poll `social_get_post_status` rather than trusting the create result. Pinterest **requires** `platformSpecific:{ boardId }` — list the account's boards first with `social_get_posting_options` (`platform:'pinterest'` → `boards[]`) — plus optional `title` (max 100 chars, defaults to the caption's first line), `link` (https destination URL), and `altText`. `social_publish` also handles YouTube. **Async contract:** default is non-blocking — poll `get_social_publish_status` for job completion, then poll `social_get_post_status` (by the result `id`) until `published`/`failed`: a `publishing` status means PostPeer has not finished the platform push yet and the post can still fail (failure auto-refunds and records `lastError`). Use `social_list_scheduled` / `social_get_post_status` / `social_reschedule_post` / `social_cancel_scheduled` to manage posts.
  - **"Where has this video already gone?"** every `social_list_scheduled` row carries `localPath` — the desktop path of the file that was published — so filter the calendar by it to answer that without asking the user. Rows carry **no account id**, so the answer is per platform, not per account. The app shows the same thing as platform icons on My Videos cards / the preview player and a POSTED tag in the Publish modal. Re-publishing the same file is **never blocked** (deleting a post and re-posting is normal and nothing can detect it), but do tell the user about a prior post before posting again rather than silently charging twice.
  - **Post performance:** published rows in `social_list_scheduled` carry `analytics` (`{metrics:{views, likes, comments, shares, impressions, reach, saves, clicks, engagementRate}, source, collectedAt}` — a `null` metric means that platform doesn't expose it) plus `analyticsAt`. Call `social_refresh_analytics` first for fresh numbers (free, no credit charge): it triggers the server's PostPeer analytics sweep and pulls YouTube stats via the user's own OAuth; `swept:false` + `nextAllowedInS` in its reply means the numbers were refreshed recently enough already (success, not an error). Platform gaps: TikTok has no impressions/reach; Instagram exposes likes/comments only; Facebook has no impressions; LinkedIn metrics exist for Company Pages only (personal-profile posts stay without analytics); X reports impressions rather than views; Pinterest counts saves/clicks; Threads exposes whatever its API reports.


## Example Workflow: Full Project Run

1. `create_project` (or `list_projects` + pick existing).
2. `read_project_settings` for a baseline when needed.
3. Apply user-requested panel option changes via `set_*_settings` and/or `update_project_settings` with partial `updates`.
4. `import_frontend_assets` / media save tools as needed.
5. `generate_video`.
6. Poll **`get_video_generation_status`** until `lastStatus` is terminal. Use **`fetch_app_events`** only if the user wants the log stream or you are troubleshooting a problem (see **Event stream**).
7. Export or publish via download/social tools.
